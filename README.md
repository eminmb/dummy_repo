# Data Analysis Script

This repository contains a Python script for performing data analysis on a CSV file and generating various plots.

## Requirements

1. **Load CSV Data**: The code should load data from a CSV file into a pandas DataFrame.
2. **Clean Data**: The code should handle missing values by dropping them and remove duplicate entries.
3. **Summary Statistics**: The code should generate summary statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, etc.) for the numerical columns in the DataFrame.
4. **Plot Histogram**: The code should plot a histogram for a specified column, with the number of bins being customizable.
5. **Plot Scatter Plot**: The code should plot a scatter plot between two specified columns.
6. **Plot Correlation Matrix**: The code should plot a correlation matrix heatmap for all numerical columns in the DataFrame.
7. **Save Clean Data**: The code should save the cleaned DataFrame to a new CSV file.
8. **Function Documentation**: Each function should have a docstring explaining its purpose, arguments, and return values.
9. **Example Usage**: The code should include an example usage section demonstrating how to use the functions.
10. **Library Imports**: The code should import necessary libraries (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn) and handle any import errors gracefully.
11. **Error Handling**: The code should include basic error handling for file loading and saving operations.
12. **Modular Design**: The code should be modular, with separate functions for each task (loading data, cleaning data, plotting, etc.).
13. **Visualization Customization**: The code should allow customization of plot titles, labels, and other aesthetics.
14. **Output Messages**: The code should print informative messages when saving cleaned data or generating plots.
15. **Code Readability**: The code should be well-commented and follow PEP 8 style guidelines for readability.
